User Finder
----------------

User Finder is an administrative tool. This [Features](http://drupal.org/project/features)-based module creates a view with exposed filters for finding users by username or email address. This view shows up as a tab on the admin/user/user page and is permissioned so that only users with 'administer users' permissions can see it.

This module makes it easy to jump to a user's account if you know (all or part of) their username _or_ email address. You can also easily show all users with email addresses from a given domain name.
